	<h2>Q<span name="number">2</span> Supply chain impact and the definition of a VENDOR</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Section 9 provides guidelines for a VENDOR as a legitimate source for COTS items.  With the supply train constraints over the past few years, we've seen parts from many vendors have significant, prolonged (>1 year) availability constraints - either backordered for significant amounts of time, or out of stock for significant amounts of time.  These issues appear to be at odds with part D of the definition.  How should teams apply this definition to these vendors and parts?</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">4</span> Discrepancy between MatchMaker software used by the field and 11.6.2</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">There appears to be a discrepancy between the match scheduling software (MatchMaker 1.5) and the game manual. According to section 11.6.2, it is a higher priority of the schedule to “minimize the number of times a team plays opposite any team” than it is to “minimize the number of times a team is allied with any team”. According to analysis, the MatchMaker 1.5 scheduler scoring favors duplicate opponents over duplicate partners by a ratio of 5 to 1, which is contradictory to 11.6.2.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">5</span> Extending beyond frame perimeter</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">G109 states that robots may not extend in more than one direction beyond the frame perimeter, crossing over only one side of the robot.  A robot deploys a T-shaped mechanism in front of the robot that then extends the top of the T longer (think G107 drawing D, with a long vertical line at the end of the extension), so that the ends are beyond the forward projection of the sides of the frame perimeter but within the boundary set by R105.

	<h2>Q<span name="number">6</span> Extension over a circular robot</h2>

	<span name="question">Per G109, robots can only extend over 1 side of the robot and a circular robot or frame section has an infinite number of sides.  Does this effectively prohibit extension of any mechanism over a circular frame segment, or is there a minimum width for a mechanism that could be extended over that frame segment?</span>

	<span name="answer">We believe Example C in the blue box under !G109 answers your question (it references a completely circular FRAME PERIMETER and also applies to a circular *part* of a FRAME PERIMETER).

	<h2>Q<span name="number">7</span> G301 Questions: Attaching to and suspending from</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Part 1:
Under G301, what is the definition of suspending from? If a robot is only contacting the top of the charge station surface and/or another robot on their alliance BUT their wheels are also over the edge of the charge station and off the ground. Is this legal or would it be a violation of G301?

Part 2:
If my robot was to use a suction cup secured to the top surface of the charge station and released at the conclusion of the match without field damage, is this a violation of G301?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We cannot comment absolutely on hypothetical scenarios. The ultimate decision would be determined by the REFEREES at your event, with the final call made by the Head REFEREE. That being said, there is no *FIRST* specific definition of "suspending from." In the absence of a definition specific to CHARGED UP, a common definition from a reputable source, like Merriam Webster's website, can apply: "to hang so as to be free on all sides except at the point of support." A ROBOT with its center of gravity above the surface of the CHARGE STATION, but with a part of it below the CHARGE STATION surface is unlikely to be assessed as "suspending from." 

!G301 prohibits a ROBOT from attaching to FIELD elements, regardless of if damage occurs (and the parenthetical specifically refers to vacuum as a method for attaching).</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">8</span> Clarification of R203 and "high intensity light sources" with vision tape placement</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The placement of the vision tape on the poles near the driver station means teams will be inadvertently blinded by their own alliances vision lights. There are fixes for this, but ultimately if someone's light does shine on a driver, they can invoke R203 and possibly have the offending device removed after reinspection. If the vision targets are between the driver and the robot the light will always hit the drivers. Is there a hard Lumen limit inspection can follow? How can we know ahead of time</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We cannot comment on part/design legality or the legality of its hypothetical use. There is no lumen limit. If an LRI or Head Referee has concern about the intensity or use of a light source, it will be addressed at the event.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">9</span> G403 Question: Definition of Completely Outside</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">G403 states that "ROBOTS completely outside their LOADING ZONE or COMMUNITY" may not control more than one game piece at a time. What qualifies a robot as "completely outside" of these key zones? Is the robot considered completely outside of the zones if the robot's bumpers are completely outside of both zones? Alternatively, for the purposes of G403, could a robot still be considered inside the loading zone/community if any part of the robot extends over the tape line defining the zone's edge?</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">"Completely outside" can be interpreted literally. If any part of the ROBOT is in its LOADING ZONE or COMMUNITY, !G403 does not apply. The Glossary definition of a ROBOT includes its BUMPERS and any extensions.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">After the game reveal, some teammates and I were playing the new xRC simulator update. However we quickly noticed that the scoring in the game was off. After some testing it turned out that the game awarded points to game pieces scored in AUTO twice.(Both the AUTO and Tele-op points) This left us and the team wondering whether that is actually what happens in competition. In the manual we couldn’t find a clear answer, so: Do game pieces scored in AUTO get both the AUTO points and Tele-op points?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">No, GAME PIECES scored in AUTO do not get counted for both AUTO and TELEOP points. GAME PIECES are scored per Table 6-2 based on when they were scored. Also note the details at the end of [Section 6.4](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2023/Manual/HTML/2023FRCGameManual.htm#_Toc124258655) for what happens with GAME PIECES scored in AUTO that are later removed.</span>

	<b>A:</b>

The FMS will enable ROBOTS 3 seconds after the end of AUTO.

As a courtesy to participants FMS provides audio cues that indicate the end of AUTO (Buzzer), and the start of TELEOP after the 3 second delay (3 Bells).

	<h2>Q<span name="number">60</span> Definition of DOCKED is slightly ambiguous - does my robot NEED to be fully supported?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">In 6.4.2, the wording of the definition of "DOCKED" is slightly lexically ambiguous:

"A ROBOT is DOCKED if it is contacting only the CHARGE STATION and/or other items also directly or 
transitively fully supported by the CHARGE STATION."

Does that mean a robot may be on the ground so long as it is in contact with a robot fully supported by the charging station? (i.e. following the "or" in the statement without the "and" as and/or sometimes means is possible).</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We sincerely apologize for the ambiguity of our lexicon. The ground is not supported by the CHARGE STATION, so a ROBOT in contact with the ground is not considered DOCKED.</span>

R710 C does not specifically allow solenoid channels for this usage. However, it seems a reasonable use of the PCH, and offers more control than simply connecting them to the PDH.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">There are no rules explicitly constraining or restricting power sources for fans.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Hi HQ staff, we had a question about Playoff Round Performance points.  Section 11.8.1.3 states that a team only earns the percentage of Alliance Advancement Points of the won Playoff Matches that they played in.  We were wondering if this only includes teams on a LINEUP, or if being a sixteenth ALLIANCE member from a team not in the LINEUP (as mentioned in section 11.7.4.1) counts as a team participating in a Playoff MATCH and thus earns Alliance Advancement Points for that MATCH?</span>
