	<h2>Q<span name="number">3</span> R408 *BUMPER construction.</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">R408 *BUMPER construction. states: BUMPERS must be constructed as follows (see Figure 9-7):
     A. be backed by ¾ in. thick (nominal, ~19mm) by 5 in. ± ½ in. (~127 mm ± 12.7 
         mm) tall plywood, Oriented Strand Board (OSB) or solid wood (with the 
         exception of balsa).

It is not listed, but would we be allowed to use recycled plastic lumber?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">!R408 lists the only materials permitted for use in backing BUMPERS; materials *not* listed in !R408 are not permitted for the use case.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">6</span> Extension over a circular robot</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Per G109, robots can only extend over 1 side of the robot and a circular robot or frame section has an infinite number of sides.  Does this effectively prohibit extension of any mechanism over a circular frame segment, or is there a minimum width for a mechanism that could be extended over that frame segment?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We believe Example C in the blue box under !G109 answers your question (it references a completely circular FRAME PERIMETER and also applies to a circular *part* of a FRAME PERIMETER). Note that exceptions A or B may apply which would allow this extension to not violate !G109.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">8</span> Clarification of R203 and "high intensity light sources" with vision tape placement</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The placement of the vision tape on the poles near the driver station means teams will be inadvertently blinded by their own alliances vision lights. There are fixes for this, but ultimately if someone's light does shine on a driver, they can invoke R203 and possibly have the offending device removed after reinspection. If the vision targets are between the driver and the robot the light will always hit the drivers. Is there a hard Lumen limit inspection can follow? How can we know ahead of time</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We cannot comment on part/design legality or the legality of its hypothetical use. There is no lumen limit. If an LRI or Head Referee has concern about the intensity or use of a light source, it will be addressed at the event.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">10</span> G301 Question : Grid Station</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">We do not see anything restricting crossing the blue tape and driving into the grid to reduce the distance of extension outside of the frame.  Provided we are able to straddle the 5" grid support legs and stop short of the ramp / April tag surface</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">There are no rules specifically prohibiting a ROBOT (or its drivetrain) from crossing the tape line at the front of the GRID.</span>
