	<h2>Q<span name="number">1</span> Major Part Manufacturing for Other Teams</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Can Team A make a major part for an assembly for Team B if Team B does not have the required equipment to fabricate the parts but does supply the materials to make the part? For example, a major part of an assembly is a sheet metal part that is very complex in how it is cut out and then bent into shape. Team A has access to a CNC Laser Cutter and CNC metal brake to fabricate the parts for Team B. Is this allowable per Rule I1?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The definition of "built by the *FIRST* Robotics Competition team" is intentionally left vague in !I1. Per the Blue Box "Neither I1 nor the language in its Blue Box define specific thresholds for how much of a MAJOR MECHANISM must be the result of the team’s effort. I1 expects and requires the team’s honest assessment of whether they built the MAJOR MECHANISMS of their ROBOT". In the provided example, where Team B has done the design and final assembly of the MECHANISM, and had Team A do the fabrication of some COMPONENTS, it sounds like Team B could reasonably say they built the MAJOR MECHANISM.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The Blue Box of I1 says "Examples that would generally not be considered MAJOR MECHANISMS, and thus probably aren’t subject to I1 include, but are not limited to, the following: ... c. COTS items"

Are there certain COTS items that would be considered MAJOR MECHANISMS on their own? Or are all COTS items exempt from being considered a MAJOR MECHANISM on their own? If the former, which COTS items currently available to teams would be considered a MAJOR MECHANISM on their own?</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Yes, the assumption is that it's possible for a COTS item to also be a MAJOR MECHANISM. We are not currently aware of any currently available COTS item that would be considered a MAJOR MECHANISM. A hypothetical 2019 example would be if a VENDOR sold an assembled, bolt-on CARGO intake.

	<h2>Q<span name="number">8</span> Value of designing parts in I1</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Does a team designing a MECHANISM influence how much the team has “built” it for the purposes of I1? 
Assuming that the MECHANISM in Q1’s example consisted entirely of COTS items and COMPONENTS manufactured by Team A, the difference between the example in Q1 and exploitation example “a” in the I1 blue box appears to be Team B having designed the mechanism themselves, is this correct?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">As we referenced in the answer to !Q1, the definition of "built by the *FIRST* Robotics Competition team" is intentionally left vague in !I1. For example, a team neither designs nor fabricates the majority of the components of the Kit of Parts drivetrain (other than trimming down some frame pieces according to instructions) however, the significant assembly involved would still lead us to say that was "built by the *FIRST* Robotics Competition team". If however, Team A designs and fabricates a MAJOR MECHANISM in a few pieces and provides it to Team B at an event with instructions on how to assemble it, this would likely be interpreted as an attempt to exploit loopholes in !I1 (even if the amount of work performed by Team B was similar in both cases).</span>

Is the vendor selling "assembled, bolt-on" mechanism key to the COTS mechanism violating I1? Would unassembled version of the same mechanism still be legal? Is the intention of this ruling to restrict the legality of teams' robots, or to steer FIRST COTS supplier options?</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The answer to Q7 indicated that "an assembled, bolt-on CARGO intake" could be considered a COTS MAJOR MECHANISM. The answer also signaled that unassembled COTS kits on the market, such as the KOP drive base, are not considered COTS MAJOR MECHANISMS. If the team purchases the former, disassembles it into constituent parts such that it resembles the latter in form, and finally re-assembles it into the original COTS state, then has the team "built" the MAJOR MECHANISM per I1?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">This question begs for a clear line (or set of lines) that define when something is built by a team (or in this case, re-built) and when it's not. The intent of !I1 is to make clear that expectation is that a team's ROBOT is the product of their work while not prohibiting *Coopertition* and help from others. If the effort described in the question is an attempt at circumventing the stated spirit of !I1, it's prohibited.</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">LRI's will be trained to handle !I1 similar to many of the previous bag rules which were also based on the honor system. The default will be to trust the team. If something seems suspicious (e.g. a MAJOR MECHANISM that appears at a re-inspection looks exactly like one on another ROBOT at the event) or there is other reason to believe !I1 may have been violated (e.g. a credible report to the LRI that a team received a MAJOR MECHANISM from another team) the LRI may investigate the matter by asking the team some questions and consulting other individuals at the event as necessary. If they come to the conclusion, beyond reasonable doubt, that !I1 has been violated, they will work with the team (with guidance from HQ as appropriate) on how to proceed with getting the ROBOT inspected.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">20</span> I1 and "mostly complete"</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Regarding the second example of exploitation of I1, what constitutes “mostly complete”? The dictionary definition of mostly is “as regards the greater part or number”. That would indicate that less than 50% of the parts used can be gifted. Is this the interpretation we should use when reading this rule?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">No, referring to a strict percentage in this way implies that this is a black and white measurement that can be made by weight, volume, or part count. 

If a team designs and fabricates the parts of a MAJOR MECHANISM with the intent of having a different team use it, the recipient team risks violating !I1. To paraphrase part  of a response given in !Q16, if there’s an attempt to circumvent the stated spirit of !I1, it's prohibited.

For example, Team B is helping Team A with A's MAJOR MECHANISM, and B realizes they have a spare custom sheet metal bracket that could be adapted to A’s MECHANISM. B offers the bracket to Team A, and A agrees to use it. They work together to install it. In this scenario, it's likely that neither team is trying to figure out how to "sell" it (to themselves, to Inspectors) that Team A really did build their MAJOR MECHANISM. 

On the other hand, consider a scenario where B designs a MAJOR MECHANISM with specific, ubiquitous COTS parts in mind and puts it together, leaving out enough of those COTS parts such that they think that !I1 wouldn’t be invoked. Team A completes the MECHANISM as instructed and uses it, even though they know the MAJOR MECHANISM was received mostly complete. This latter example is an example of an attempt to exploit !I1, and not in the spirit of the *FIRST* Robotics Competition.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">27</span> What Makes a Credible Report?</h2>

	<span name="question">Q19 says, “If…there is other reason to believe I1 may have been violated (e.g. a credible report to the LRI that a team received a MAJOR MECHANISM from another team) the LRI may investigate the matter…”

Are there minimum criteria for a credible report? Do pictures/video of one team working on another team’s robot qualify? Can you give an example of evidence that would qualify? If these reports come after playing matches with the illegal mechanism, could the team see retroactive penalties?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Reporting circumstances vary so widely it's not possible for us to give minimum criteria for credibility. However, it's accurate to say the more evidence presented (such as multiple witnesses and a MAJOR MECHANISM suddenly appearing on a team's ROBOT in the Playoff MATCHES) the more credible the report will be, and the more likely an LRI is to investigate.

If a team is in violation of an inspection rule, and that violation is not discovered until after a match is played in an illegal configuration, retroactive penalties could be assessed. In this situation, the LRI will consult with the Head REFEREE, and *FIRST* HQ as necessary, to determine the appropriate penalty. As this situation could have a significant impact on the team and possibly the ALLIANCE, teams are encouraged to consult with the LRI in advance if they are unsure if their activities violate inspection rules.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">What are the limits of "motor shafts modified" as part of R14.D.iii, specifically with regards to removing or replacing material? 
Examples: 
Cutting a shaft to be shorter, but with the same cross section.
Cutting a shaft to have a different cross section (round to hex, adding a keyway etc).
Replacing the shaft with a duplicate part.
Replacing the shaft with a purchased alternate part.
Replacing the shaft with a published alternate part made by the team.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">There are no limitations specified in R14 regarding how the motor shaft may be modified. Note that this rule only specifies allowable modifications prior to Kickoff and other rules impose additional restrictions on allowable modifications.</span>

	<span name="question">If an item is purchased in a qty greater than 1, say a package of 100 bolts for $6 or a pack of 4 of something for $19.99.

Do these complete packs need to be listed on the BOM at their total price or can we account for them at $0 since each individual item costs less than $5 and would fall under the exception.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A reasonable (and legal) way to assess the FMV of a single widget (e.g. bolt) when purchased as part of a larger quantity is to divide the total cost by the quantity purchased. If that value is less than $5, then it doesn't need to be valued on the BOM per !R11-A.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Can a team use a robot design such as an elevator design from one of their previous robots if they have not publicly published the CAD and coding files? (Built from scratch – not using previous parts) 
Is the answer different if the team makes some minor design revisions such as the type of rollers used or the method of attachment to the robot or the height to which it must travel?
If CAD files are required to be published, must the code to actuate the elevator be published also?</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Teams may not reuse a ROBOT design from a previous year's ROBOT if source files are not publicly released per !R15. Example 1 in the blue box of !R15 provides an example similar to your first scenario. Minor design changes do not exempt a design from being subject to !R15. Example 2 in the blue box gives an example similar to this scenario. The code is subject to !R15 if the team intends to reuse it. If the team only intends to reuse the mechanical design, software does not need to be released.</span>

If the kit can only assemble in a single configuration and requires specific external parts to do so (ignoring trivialities like being able to use bolts that are too long and have them stick out or need to be cut off), then the FMV of the kit would need to be assessed against !R12 with these parts included.

	<h2>Q<span name="number">148</span> Follow Up to Q140 - What are "critical part of the profile"s</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">How is a team or inspector supposed to know what parts of a COTS item or material are "critical" or a "critical part of the profile" when identifying Identical Functional Replacements (IFRs)? If two parts/items are similar but have some difference(s) and "provided the use on the ROBOT does not depend on the alternate feature(s)" can they still be IFRs of each other?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We cannot rule absolutely on hypothetical ROBOT designs, and the final decision as to legality of a particular ROBOT lies with the Lead ROBOT Inspector (LRI) at each event.

We encourage teams to use parts as close as possible, within reason, and we believe the answer to !Q140 provides enough guidance to teams and inspectors to know which parts work as an Identical Functional Replacement.</span>

	<span name="question">The red ALLIANCE has 10 POWER CELLS on their LOADING BAY racks. The blue ALLIANCE scores 10 POWER CELLS in an arbitrarily short period of time. The red ALLIANCE is now supposedly violating both H9 and H10. Obviously it would be advantageous for the red ALLIANCE to comply with H10 first, delaying introducing POWER CELLS to the FIELD. The blue ALLIANCE would benefit more from the red ALLIANCE complying with H9 first.

Should the red ALLIANCE come into compliance with H9 or H10 first?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The purpose of the Q&A is not to provide strategic advice. 

If an ALLIANCE simultaneously violates !H9 and !H10 and can't remedy them in parallel, then (according to !H9 and !H10 and their respective Blue Boxes), a remedy of !H9 first promptly followed by a remedy to !H10 is unlikely to result in any violations. If the ALLIANCE opts to remedy !H10 first and then !H9, they're at risk of receiving !H9 penalties.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">In regards to the answer to Q107, (As long as G26 is not violated, there are no restrictions on how ROBOTS can interact with any part of the FIELD.)

And per G26 ROBOTS are prohibited from grabbing, grasping, attaching, etc ARENA elements with the exceptions of the POWER CELL, HANDLE, and ALLIANCE'S Control Panel.

Would a force applied to the underside of a field element on a single face be considered grabbing, grasping, or attaching?</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We cannot comment absolutely on hypothetical scenarios. The ultimate decision would be determined by the REFEREES at your event, with the final call made by the Head REFEREE. Ultimately, !G26 protects both the ROBOTS and the playing FIELD. We encourage teams to make it clear that any interaction will not result in FIELD or ROBOT damage in order to avoid a !G26 violation.</span>

Given the explicit mentions were both RED CARDS in previous years and C1 has the option for nothing, YELLOW, or RED CARDS from the head referee, should we view these as the same penalty as before (red cards) or can any of the penalties apply?

It is important to note that the list in the blue box if !C1 is not exhaustive, but it does provide our community with insight about explicit actions that will result in cards.

!C8 could still result in a YELLOW or RED CARD, if the Head REFEREES deems the behavior is egregious.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">297</span> defensive blocker a violation of I1?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Teams RED1, RED2, and RED3 form a playoff alliance.  At the time of alliance selection, all three of these robots are short enough to fit under the trench.  The three teams work together to add a makeshift non-articulated cardboard structure to RED3's robot that brings it's height close to the 45" maximum.  In playoff matches RED3 uses this new-found height to block Power Cells being shot by the opposing alliance.  For the purpose of I1, is defensive shot-blocking considered a game challenge?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">An assembly used to deflect POWER CELLS is a MAJOR MECHANISM because it "address[es] at least one (1) game challenge" e.g. "game piece control" and/or "field element manipulation." !I1 requires that the MAJOR MECHANISM was built by the ROBOT's team, but does not prohibit assistance from other teams. From the Blue Box under !I1, "Neither I1 nor the language in its Blue Box define specific thresholds for how much of a MAJOR MECHANISM must be the result of the team’s effort. I1 expects and requires the team’s honest assessment of whether they built the MAJOR MECHANISMS of their ROBOT."</span>
