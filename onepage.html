	<h2>Q<span name="number">1</span> Clarification on meaning of "straddle" in G302</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">G302 says "ROBOTS may not reach into or straddle the LOWER EXIT." In this case, does straddling mean to have a portion of your robot on both sides of the LOWER EXIT, and potentially above the LOWER EXIT?

And does that mean that a robot in the path of cargo exiting the LOWER EXIT, but whose bounding box does not intersect the LOWER EXIT is not straddling?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Your described definition sounds consistent with the common definition of "straddle" that is intended. Yes, a ROBOT may be parked in the path of exiting CARGO without violating !G302 provided it is not straddling the LOWER EXIT.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">4</span> Defense causing another robot to shoot out of bounds</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">G401 states that robots ejecting cargo from the field is a foul, and G201 says that robots may not use strategies that intend to force an opponent to violate a rule. If a defending robot hits another robot in the process of shooting a ball and causes that shot to land out of bounds, would this be a violation of G401 on the shooting robot or a violation of G201 on the defending robot?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We cannot comment absolutely on hypothetical scenarios. The ultimate decision would be determined by the REFEREES at your event, with the final call made by the Head REFEREE. Generally, rule !G201 requires a "Strateg[y] clearly aimed at forcing the opponent ALLIANCE to violate a rule". If the ROBOT'S action could be consistent with standard gameplay, such as legally defending an opponent ROBOT, it is unlikely !G201 would be called.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">5</span> Human Players shooting between Auto and Teleop</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">H504 says that during TELEOP (actually says AUTO, but assuming that is a typo), human players can only introduce CARGO to the field through the GUARD. Does this period start immediately after AUTO ends, or does it not include the delay after AUTO and before the start of TELEOP? If so, can human players take shots during that delay period?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We have corrected the manual to reflect the change described in [Team Update 01](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2022/Manual/TeamUpdates/TeamUpdate01.pdf). Our apologies, and thank you for letting us know! 

Table 5-1 describes when AUTO ends (the timer displays 0:00, meaning CARGO cannot be entered using the criteria in !H404 after that point) and when TELEOP begins (the timer displays 2:15, meaning that TELEOP-specific rules do not apply until then).</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">6</span> Cargo PSI Question</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The description of Cargo states that "CARGO is inflated to 3½ psi." However, a Cargo ball inflated to 3.5 psi is very deflated and doesn't conform to the "bounces back to a height between 2 ft. 1 in. (~64 cm) and 2 ft. 6 in. (~76 cm) (as measured from the bottom of the ball)" section of the Cargo description. 3.5 psi is much too low to be the correct psi; what is the intended psi of the Cargo?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Thanks for the question. We are pretty sure the PSI is correct. Keep in mind, gauges designed to read higher pressures tend to be inaccurate when measuring lower pressures. We recommend a gauge designed to read in the 15-20 psi range or lower ([this gauge](https://soccer.epicsports.com/prod/14762/champion-sports-pressure-gauge.html) will be used at official events). Alternatively, your gauge may be broken. If your gauge is of an appropriate range and you've confirmed it's functioning properly, please send additional details to [firstroboticscompetition@firstinspires.org](mailto:firstroboticscompetition@firstinspires.org).</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">If a ROBOT extends in such a way that it blocks both entrances to the opposite ALLIANCE HANGAR, a FOUL would be issued per G107 at the moment that the extension reaches beyond 16 inches, with no recurring fouls occurring if the MECHANISM stays beyond 16 inches.

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Correct, !G203 is not invoked if only a single ROBOT. [Section 11.2.1](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2022/Manual/Sections/2022FRCGameManual-11.pdf) states that "YELLOW CARDS and RED CARDS are used in _FIRST_ Robotics Competition to address team and ROBOT behavior that does not align with the mission, values, and culture of _FIRST_."

	<span name="question">Provided that g301 is not violated, is it legal to drive up the wall such that the wall is partially supporting a robot's weight?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We cannot rule absolutely on hypothetical ROBOT designs or their implementation, and the final decision as to legality of a particular ROBOT lies with the Lead ROBOT Inspector (LRI) at each event. Additionally, per [Section 1.10](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2022/Manual/Sections/2022FRCGameManual-01.pdf), the Q&A "is not a resource for firm predictions on how a situation will play out an event. Questions about the following will not be addressed...
* rulings on vague situations, 
* challenging decisions made at past events, or 
* design reviews of a ROBOT system for legality."

As such, broad questions along the lines of "is this particular ROBOT action legal?" are outside the scope of the Q&A and for the team to determine after thorough review and analysis of the rule set. Instead, the Q&A supports understanding and clarification of rules. If a question states that a ROBOT does not violate a specific rule, and asks if it violates any other rules, the answer will be along the lines of this answer. Instead, please review all rules thoroughly, and if any rules are unclear and you're unable to use them to make your own determination, please submit a question inquiring about that particular rule.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Would driving a wheel against the alliance/hanger wall (for a protracted length of time, ie not as incidental contact) violate G303? Such an action could result in the wall partially supporting the weight of the robot (perhaps as much as 50% of the weight).  It could also cause markings on the wall, either minimally each time or significantly, depending on a number of factors.  This action would be strategic, in an effort to solve or minimize the difficulty of game tasks.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Assuming you are referring to !G301, it would not be explicitly prohibited provided it does not damage any ARENA elements. The ALLIANCE WALL was not designed to support ROBOTS and we are unable to assess whether a particular ROBOT design would damage either of the two types of FIELD perimeter (as described in [Section 5.1](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2022/Manual/HTML/2022FRCGameManual.htm#_Toc92292209)).

If a ROBOT is hanging from a RUNG and would qualify for HANGAR points, but then a CARGO ball rolls over, contacts the ROBOT (and is clearly not supporting the ROBOT), and remains in contact until 5 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0, does the ROBOT receive zero HANGAR points?</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">33</span> Please clarify HUMAN PLAYER use of signaling to guide ROBOTS to the TERMINAL?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">H303 lists "non-powered signaling" as ok in item "B", and also says, in IV.b, that communicating with the robot is ok.

But it also says that "mimicing" vision targets used on the field is not ok.  What constitutes "mimicing"?  Is all retroreflective material banned?

H303 also says that a "large signaling device" would be a safety hazard.  Could you clarify what dimensions constitute "large"?  The size of a ping pong paddle?  A tennis racket?  A hockey stick?  An open umbrella?

Thanks!  :-)</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">There is no specific definition of "mimicing". Generally a target of substantially different size and/or shape would be unlikely to be mimicing the field Vision Targets, even if it is made of similar material. There is no specific threshold for a "large" signalling device becoming unsafe as it would depend on other factors such as shape, material, and usage. Remember that you will be sharing a TERMINAL AREA with a member of the other ALLIANCE! Also note that per !H403 you may not signal to the ROBOT during AUTO.</span>

One of the two cargo we received in our kit of parts has a minor diameter of about 8.5 inches and a major diameter of about 10.25 inches.
