	<h2>Q<span name="number">3</span> R408 *BUMPER construction.</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">R408 *BUMPER construction. states: BUMPERS must be constructed as follows (see Figure 9-7):
     A. be backed by ¾ in. thick (nominal, ~19mm) by 5 in. ± ½ in. (~127 mm ± 12.7 
         mm) tall plywood, Oriented Strand Board (OSB) or solid wood (with the 
         exception of balsa).

It is not listed, but would we be allowed to use recycled plastic lumber?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">!R408 lists the only materials permitted for use in backing BUMPERS; materials *not* listed in !R408 are not permitted for the use case.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">6</span> Extension over a circular robot</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Per G109, robots can only extend over 1 side of the robot and a circular robot or frame section has an infinite number of sides.  Does this effectively prohibit extension of any mechanism over a circular frame segment, or is there a minimum width for a mechanism that could be extended over that frame segment?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We believe Example C in the blue box under !G109 answers your question (it references a completely circular FRAME PERIMETER and also applies to a circular *part* of a FRAME PERIMETER). Note that exceptions A or B may apply which would allow this extension to not violate !G109.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">7</span> G301 Questions: Attaching to and suspending from</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Part 1:
Under G301, what is the definition of suspending from? If a robot is only contacting the top of the charge station surface and/or another robot on their alliance BUT their wheels are also over the edge of the charge station and off the ground. Is this legal or would it be a violation of G301?

Part 2:
If my robot was to use a suction cup secured to the top surface of the charge station and released at the conclusion of the match without field damage, is this a violation of G301?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We cannot comment absolutely on hypothetical scenarios. The ultimate decision would be determined by the REFEREES at your event, with the final call made by the Head REFEREE. That being said, there is no *FIRST* specific definition of "suspending from." In the absence of a definition specific to CHARGED UP, a common definition from a reputable source, like Merriam Webster's website, can apply: "to hang so as to be free on all sides except at the point of support." A ROBOT with its center of gravity above the surface of the CHARGE STATION, but with a part of it below the CHARGE STATION surface is unlikely to be assessed as "suspending from." 

!G301 prohibits a ROBOT from attaching to FIELD elements, regardless of if damage occurs (and the parenthetical specifically refers to vacuum as a method for attaching).</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">8</span> Clarification of R203 and "high intensity light sources" with vision tape placement</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The placement of the vision tape on the poles near the driver station means teams will be inadvertently blinded by their own alliances vision lights. There are fixes for this, but ultimately if someone's light does shine on a driver, they can invoke R203 and possibly have the offending device removed after reinspection. If the vision targets are between the driver and the robot the light will always hit the drivers. Is there a hard Lumen limit inspection can follow? How can we know ahead of time</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We cannot comment on part/design legality or the legality of its hypothetical use. There is no lumen limit. If an LRI or Head Referee has concern about the intensity or use of a light source, it will be addressed at the event.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">13</span> Do game pieces, scored in AUTO, receive both the AUTO points and Tele-op points?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">After the game reveal, some teammates and I were playing the new xRC simulator update. However we quickly noticed that the scoring in the game was off. After some testing it turned out that the game awarded points to game pieces scored in AUTO twice.(Both the AUTO and Tele-op points) This left us and the team wondering whether that is actually what happens in competition. In the manual we couldn’t find a clear answer, so: Do game pieces scored in AUTO get both the AUTO points and Tele-op points?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">No, GAME PIECES scored in AUTO do not get counted for both AUTO and TELEOP points. GAME PIECES are scored per Table 6-2 based on when they were scored. Also note the details at the end of [Section 6.4](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2023/Manual/HTML/2023FRCGameManual.htm#_Toc124258655) for what happens with GAME PIECES scored in AUTO that are later removed.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">14</span> Can both robots interacting in G207 gain the foul?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">If a robot is partially within its loading zone and touches another robot partially within its loading zone are both robots awarded a foul</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We cannot comment absolutely on hypothetical scenarios. The ultimate decision would be determined by the REFEREES at your event, with the final call made by the Head REFEREE.

However, per the second image in !G207's blue box, it is possible for both ROBOTS in an interaction to be awarded !G207 FOULS. As a reminder, a !G207 violation occurs when a ROBOT in the opponent's zone contacts an opponent ROBOT, regardless of where the opponent is located.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">18</span> extention below robot</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">would an extension below the robot raise the bumper to be outside the bumper zone breaking r402?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We cannot rule absolutely on hypothetical ROBOT designs, and the final decision as to legality of a particular ROBOT lies with the Lead ROBOT Inspector (LRI) at each event. 

Per !R402, BUMPERS must be located entirely within the BUMPER ZONE. As noted in !R402's Blue Box example 2, deploying a MECHANISM which lifts the BUMPERS outside of the BUMPER ZONE is a violation of the rule.</span>
