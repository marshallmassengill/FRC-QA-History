	<h2>Q<span name="number">2</span> Supply chain impact and the definition of a VENDOR</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Section 9 provides guidelines for a VENDOR as a legitimate source for COTS items.  With the supply train constraints over the past few years, we've seen parts from many vendors have significant, prolonged (>1 year) availability constraints - either backordered for significant amounts of time, or out of stock for significant amounts of time.  These issues appear to be at odds with part D of the definition.  How should teams apply this definition to these vendors and parts?</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">4</span> Discrepancy between MatchMaker software used by the field and 11.6.2</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">There appears to be a discrepancy between the match scheduling software (MatchMaker 1.5) and the game manual. According to section 11.6.2, it is a higher priority of the schedule to “minimize the number of times a team plays opposite any team” than it is to “minimize the number of times a team is allied with any team”. According to analysis, the MatchMaker 1.5 scheduler scoring favors duplicate opponents over duplicate partners by a ratio of 5 to 1, which is contradictory to 11.6.2.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">5</span> Extending beyond frame perimeter</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">G109 states that robots may not extend in more than one direction beyond the frame perimeter, crossing over only one side of the robot.  A robot deploys a T-shaped mechanism in front of the robot that then extends the top of the T longer (think G107 drawing D, with a long vertical line at the end of the extension), so that the ends are beyond the forward projection of the sides of the frame perimeter but within the boundary set by R105.

	<h2>Q<span name="number">6</span> Extension over a circular robot</h2>

	<span name="question">Per G109, robots can only extend over 1 side of the robot and a circular robot or frame section has an infinite number of sides.  Does this effectively prohibit extension of any mechanism over a circular frame segment, or is there a minimum width for a mechanism that could be extended over that frame segment?</span>

	<span name="answer">We believe Example C in the blue box under !G109 answers your question (it references a completely circular FRAME PERIMETER and also applies to a circular *part* of a FRAME PERIMETER).

	<h2>Q<span name="number">7</span> G301 Questions: Attaching to and suspending from</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Part 1:
Under G301, what is the definition of suspending from? If a robot is only contacting the top of the charge station surface and/or another robot on their alliance BUT their wheels are also over the edge of the charge station and off the ground. Is this legal or would it be a violation of G301?

Part 2:
If my robot was to use a suction cup secured to the top surface of the charge station and released at the conclusion of the match without field damage, is this a violation of G301?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We cannot comment absolutely on hypothetical scenarios. The ultimate decision would be determined by the REFEREES at your event, with the final call made by the Head REFEREE. That being said, there is no *FIRST* specific definition of "suspending from." In the absence of a definition specific to CHARGED UP, a common definition from a reputable source, like Merriam Webster's website, can apply: "to hang so as to be free on all sides except at the point of support." A ROBOT with its center of gravity above the surface of the CHARGE STATION, but with a part of it below the CHARGE STATION surface is unlikely to be assessed as "suspending from." 

!G301 prohibits a ROBOT from attaching to FIELD elements, regardless of if damage occurs (and the parenthetical specifically refers to vacuum as a method for attaching).</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">8</span> Clarification of R203 and "high intensity light sources" with vision tape placement</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The placement of the vision tape on the poles near the driver station means teams will be inadvertently blinded by their own alliances vision lights. There are fixes for this, but ultimately if someone's light does shine on a driver, they can invoke R203 and possibly have the offending device removed after reinspection. If the vision targets are between the driver and the robot the light will always hit the drivers. Is there a hard Lumen limit inspection can follow? How can we know ahead of time</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We cannot comment on part/design legality or the legality of its hypothetical use. There is no lumen limit. If an LRI or Head Referee has concern about the intensity or use of a light source, it will be addressed at the event.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">9</span> G403 Question: Definition of Completely Outside</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">G403 states that "ROBOTS completely outside their LOADING ZONE or COMMUNITY" may not control more than one game piece at a time. What qualifies a robot as "completely outside" of these key zones? Is the robot considered completely outside of the zones if the robot's bumpers are completely outside of both zones? Alternatively, for the purposes of G403, could a robot still be considered inside the loading zone/community if any part of the robot extends over the tape line defining the zone's edge?</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">"Completely outside" can be interpreted literally. If any part of the ROBOT is in its LOADING ZONE or COMMUNITY, !G403 does not apply. The Glossary definition of a ROBOT includes its BUMPERS and any extensions.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">After the game reveal, some teammates and I were playing the new xRC simulator update. However we quickly noticed that the scoring in the game was off. After some testing it turned out that the game awarded points to game pieces scored in AUTO twice.(Both the AUTO and Tele-op points) This left us and the team wondering whether that is actually what happens in competition. In the manual we couldn’t find a clear answer, so: Do game pieces scored in AUTO get both the AUTO points and Tele-op points?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">No, GAME PIECES scored in AUTO do not get counted for both AUTO and TELEOP points. GAME PIECES are scored per Table 6-2 based on when they were scored. Also note the details at the end of [Section 6.4](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2023/Manual/HTML/2023FRCGameManual.htm#_Toc124258655) for what happens with GAME PIECES scored in AUTO that are later removed.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">31</span> Extending in multiple directions to score within COMMUNITY</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">G109 has two exceptions which allow extending beyond the FRAME PERIMETER in multiple directions, one of which is "A ROBOT fully contained within its LOADING ZONE or COMMUNITY".  However, G109 also states that it is a TECH FOUL if extending in multiple directions scores a GAME PIECE.  Is it still a TECH FOUL if the ROBOT scoring the GAME PIECE is fully-contained within its COMMUNITY?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">No, any ROBOT fully contained within their COMMUNITY is an exception to !G109, and so no part of the violation applies.</span>

	<span name="question">May a team bring a passive visual target and display it through the driver station window, as allowed in H303B, that are similar to the AprilTags used on the field, but different in obvious ways, for example, a different AprilTag family, or a two-foot square instead of 6 inches, or a round tag like WhyCon or CCTag.  How similar would such a passive target need to be to be considered "mimicry"?</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">In order to be considered mimicry an image would need to be reasonably likely to be falsely detected as a FIELD target. AprilTags of other families, or other tag systems, are unlikely to be falsely detected as a target. An AprilTag identical to a FIELD target, but at a different size would be considered mimicry. AprilTags of the same family (16h5) with IDs not used on the field would also be considered mimicry as they may be detected by a system which chooses to naively align with any target presented.</span>

This extension could be flexible/foldable/moveable/etc. "If the robot were placed on a flat surface, the flexible material would bend and the lowest point of the robot would be less than 7.5 inches below the top of the robot's bumpers." {FRC#3504 - Q4-2018}. ----- Thank you and have a fantastic day. - Spectrum</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Hi Spectrum!

We cannot rule absolutely on hypothetical ROBOT designs, and the final decision as to legality of a particular ROBOT lies with the Lead ROBOT Inspector (LRI) at each event.

Generally, if the MECHANISM or COMPONENT that extends below the "normal lowest point of the ROBOT" does not lift the ROBOT enough to move the BUMPERS out of the BUMPER ZONE, it is not a violation of !R402.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Regarding G301-F, the definition used to assess whether or not a ROBOT is “suspending from” the ARENA can have a material impact on a ROBOT’s legality, so receiving a definitive response to the following prior to when a ROBOT competes in a MATCH would be appreciated: If a ROBOT’s center of gravity is horizontally to the side of and lower than, but not directly underneath, the volume encompassing all points of contact between the ROBOT and ARENA, is the robot “suspending from” the ARENA? Thanks!</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We still cannot comment absolutely on hypothetical scenarios. The ultimate decision is made by the REFEREES at your event, with the final call made by the Head REFEREE. Generally, a ROBOT supporting itself from the surface of the CHARGE STATION such that its center of gravity is lower than that surface is likely to be perceived as suspending or hanging from the CHARGE STATION surface. There may be circumstances where that's not the case.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">46</span> Delay between AUTO and TELEOP Periods</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Could you elaborate more on how the transition between the Autonomous and the TeleOperated period will work?
1) During the 3 second delay, what is the status of the robot? Will it be Disabled, Enabled in Auto mode, or Enabled in TeleOp Mode?
2) When may Drive Teams step forward and take control of their robots? At the end of the Auto period, or at the start of the TeleOp period? Will there be a coordinated instruction from the Emcee similar to FTC? ("Drivers Pick Up Your Controllers. 3 2 1 Go!)</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">1) ROBOTS are disabled during the transition from AUTO to TELEOP. 2) AUTO ends when the timer reaches 0. At that point, AUTO rules no longer apply, and DRIVE TEAMS may step forward. 3) There will not be a coordinated count down to the start of TELEOP. The FMS will enable ROBOTS 3 seconds after the end of AUTO.

As a courtesy to participants FMS provides audio cues that indicate the end of AUTO (Buzzer), and the start of TELEOP after the 3 second delay (3 Bells). Please also note that audio cues are not intended as official MATCH markers. If there is a discrepancy between an audio cue and the FIELD timers, the FIELD timers are the authority.</span>
